## Database Schema (Drizzle + Supabase)

```typescript
// Core tables needed from Phase 1
partnerships: id, user1_id, user2_id, created_at, active;
users: id, email, name, starting_weight, height, created_at;
workouts: id, user_id, date, exercises_json, photo_url, created_at;
streaks: user_id, current_streak, best_streak, last_workout_date;

// Added in Phase 3
progress_snapshots: user_id, date, weight, measurements_json, photo_url;

// Added in Phase 6
bets: partnership_id, amount, period, winner_id, settled;
punishments: bet_id, description, completed, proof_photo_url;
```

## Key Technical Decisions

- **Mobile-first responsive design** (most gym usage is mobile)
- **Real-time updates** via Supabase subscriptions
- **Photo storage** in Supabase buckets with automatic compression
- **Type-safe API** with tRPC for better DX
- **Progressive enhancement** - core features work without JS

This roadmap builds incrementally where each phase creates a usable app that gets progressively more engaging!
